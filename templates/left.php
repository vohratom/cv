				Worked as a Marketing Specialist, Recruiter for a great startup which was redefining standards of job search.<br>
				<br>
				How?<br>
				Inventive copywriting of the individual job posts so that the candidates understand well<br>
				the position.<br>
				<br>
				What did I do for perfect delivery?<br>
				Created on-line campaigns for job offers mainly through LinkedIn Recruiter, AdWords or Facebook Ads depending on position and seniority.<br>
				<br>
				How did I know that the campaign was running OK?<br>
				Followed statistics on Google Analytics and if the campaign was poor, fine-tuned it according to CTR, checked the relevance of the incoming CVs.<br>
				<br>
				What have I done after?<br>
				Then I evaluated the campaigns, communicated with HR departments and managers.<br>
				<br>
				How many resumes have I read?<br>
				More than 2000.<br>
				<br>
				What else was I responsible for?<br>
				1. Setting up new processes.<br>
				2. I had a budget of $1000/Month for website improvements.<br>
				<br>
				What did I improve?<br>
				Imagine that you have 20+ campaigns at the same time and you receive loads of resumes every day. It's hard to keep HR's inboxes protected from irrelevant candidates and to keep in mind relevant replies. So we established a simple yet efficient system of colors and running numbers coding to keep everything on track and send only relevant resumes to client's HR.<br>
				<br>
				Why did I quit?<br>
				Iâ€™ve decided to move to the United Kingdom to experience working abroad and improve English.<br>

				My passion was to learn software testing. So I've learned SQL and after that, I've found a job for the biggest bank in the Czech Republic.<br>
				<br>
				Project I was in?<br>
				Testing of Internet Banking System and Real-Estate Valuations.<br>
				<br>
				Experience gained?<br>
				A lot of experiences with SQL and databases. Every single step required very specific conditions. For example, find or create a user which is between 25-30 years, with the salary higher than $20k and mortgage up to $100k, living in Prague. I got a very deep insight into preparing and setting up conditions.<br>

				I was responsible for three projects:<br>
				<br>
				1. Medical panel - a database of doctors who we could contact and ask them about their opinion. I was managing all the campaigns with doctors. It means that we asked them by CATI (Computer-Assisted Telephones Interviewing) or CAWI (Computer Aided Web Interviewing) for their opinion about any specific topic and then we evaluated all the responses.<br>
				<br>
				2. IT helpdesk - for our internal Call-centrum. Installing new software, repair daily bugs, and so on. Remote Support, usually via TeamViewer.<br>
				<br>
				3. IT background for external conferences in CZ and SR.<br>
				<br>
				What I've made successfully?<br>
				- Cleared the database of 275 000 rows and 35 columns from duplicities, BUT, do NOT lose any information. Why shouldn't I use Excel's functions? Because I didn't know what was more actual information of each pair of rows. So I founded a team of ten people and started clearing it manually. I knew that we could meet the deadline, and I had to change the strategy. I started looking for a programmer who was able to make it automatically and overnight. Well, I found him and he made it! I was so happy when I woke up and saw the result - cleared database. I was proud that I solved the problem, even if I chose the wrong way at the beginning.<br>
